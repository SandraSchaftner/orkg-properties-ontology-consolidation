Such in-line documentation complements the use of both formal techniques (Ontology and rule languages) and informal (prose documentation, examples, test cases). A variety of documentation forms can be combined to indicate the intended meaning of the classes and properties described in an RDF vocabulary. Since RDF vocabularies are expressed as RDF graphs, vocabularies defined in other namespaces may be used to provide richer documentation.",2020-01-17T12:34:56.828+01:00

https://orkg.org/property/P33022,P33022,"The size of data that is being considered for processing is probably the most important factor. If the data can fit into the system memory, then clusters are usually not required and the entire data can be processed on a single machine. The platforms such as GPU, Multicore CPUs etc. can be used to speed up the data processing in this case. If the data does not fit into the system memory, then one has to look at other cluster options such as Hadoop, Spark etc. Again, Hadoop and Spark clusters can handle large amount of data but Hadoop has well developed tools and frameworks although it is slower for iterative tasks. The user has to decide if he needs to use off-the-shelf tools which are available for Hadoop or if he wants to optimize the cluster performance in which case Spark is more appropriate",,2020-11-24T06:17:25.508858+01:00

A well-chosen vocabulary size balances the trade-off between capturing enough linguistic information and maintaining computational efficiency. ​In summary, vocabulary size is a critical parameter in SLMs that influences memory usage, computational requirements, and overall model performance. In SLMs, the vocabulary size ranges from 32k to 256k.​",2022-04-27T20:31:49.964549Z

https://orkg.org/property/P119142,P119142,carbon emitted (tCO2eq),"measured in ""metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent."" It is a unit of measurement used to express the amount of greenhouse gas emissions produced by human activities, such as burning fossil fuels, industrial processes, deforestation, agriculture, and recently training large-scale generative AI models. The term ""equivalent"" is used because different greenhouse gases have varying global warming potentials (GWP), meaning they trap different amounts of heat in the atmosphere over specific time frames.  Carbon dioxide (CO2) is the most common greenhouse gas emitted by human activities, but there are other greenhouse gases like methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O), which are more potent in terms of their heat-trapping ability compared to CO2. When calculating the total greenhouse gas emissions, the contributions of different gases are converted into a common unit of measurement, which is the metric ton of carbon dioxide equivalent (tCO2eq), to provide a standardized and comparable value for the total impact on climate change.  By using tCO2eq, it becomes easier to understand the overall environmental impact of various activities and implement strategies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to mitigate climate change.",2023-08-02T13:47:09.065333+02:00

https://orkg.org/property/P123038,P123038,Research Object,"Architecture Analysis Method
A method for analyzing existing software architectures, e.g., to measure or evaluate specific qualities or functions.

Architecture Design Method
A method for designing software architectures, e.g., to obtain specific qualities or functions.

Architecture Optimization Method
A method to optimize existing architectures (implemented or designed) to regarding specific qualities or properties.

Architecture Evolution
The  process  of  maintaining  and adapting  existing  software architecture to meet requirement and environmental changes [Imran et al., 2016]. This includes papers that investigate the evolution of specific architectures.

Architecture Description Language
A formal or software language to create a description of a software architecture, i.e., ""any form of expression for use in architecture descriptions"" [ISO/IEC 42010].

Architecture Decision Making
In software development and evolution, decision-making is an integral part. Thus, various decisions are being made throughout the software development life cycle concerning processes, products, tools, methods, and techniques. From a decision-making perspective, all these questions are confronted by different objectives and constraints, a huge number of variables under dynamically  changing  requirements,  processes,  actors,  stakeholders,  tools  and  techniques. This is combined with incomplete, fuzzy or inconsistent information about all the involved artefacts. [Ruhe2003]

Reference Architecture
A description of an architecture (e.g. domain-specific or to solve recurring problems) that can be tailored to specific use cases.

Architecture Pattern
An architectural pattern is a general, reusable solution to a commonly occurring problem in software architecture within a given context. Patterns with negative effects on the product, i.e., anti-patterns, are also included here. [Taylor et al, 2009]

Architecture Description
An Architecture Description (AD) is a work product used to express the Architecture of some System Of Interest. An AD describes one possible Architecture for a System Of Interest. An AD may take the form of a document, a set of models, a model repository, or some other form [ISO/IEC 42010].

Architectural Aspects
A method for identifying or specifying specific architectural aspects in existing implemented architectures, e.g., automatically identifying transactional contexts in an architecture. Note that if you analyse an architecture description containing these aspects, the analysis is a separate research object.

Technical Debt
""In software-intensive systems, technical debt consists of design or implementation constructs that are expedient in the short term, but set up a technical context that can make a future change more costly or impossible. Technical debt is a contingent liability whose impact is limited to internal system qualities, primarily maintainability and evolvability."" [Avgeriou2016]

Architecture Extraction
Designing and realizing methods and algorithms to automatically extract architecture information from existing implementations.

Architectural Assumptions
Assumptions are the reasons for architectural decisions that are more or less arbitrarily taken on the fly because of personal experience, background, domain knowledge, the artifacts reused, and the like [Lago et al., 2005]",2023-10-06T14:52:09.883451+02:00

Numerous studies in the research field emphasise the importance of the recognition of indigenous rights for processes of social decolonisation and democratisation and identify their guarantee as a central prerequisite for the protection of ecologically sensitive regions (e.g. Bebbington et al. 2018). protection of ecologically sensitive regions. However, they often tend to focus indigenous groups in conflicts over land and resources on the defence of ""traditional ways of life"" and a ""harmonious relationship with nature"" and thus run the risk of ignoring important objectives which, in addition to the defence of land and raw materials, can also include coping with social change and improving the general living conditions of the affected population groups.",,2024-01-03T11:24:06.428393338+01:00
